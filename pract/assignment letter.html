    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the awesome science faculty,we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subject falls somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intellegent,dedicated researcher,and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine,and the health benefit of resveratrol(C14H12O3)</li>
        <li>measuring the effect on perfomance on funk bassplayers at temprature exceeding 30&deg;c(86&deg;f),when the audience sizeexponentially increase(effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 10<sup>4</sup>) </li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representingmusical scores </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long youd expect the research to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>yes you are right, as part of my post-doctorate work,i <em>did</em> studys exotic tribal dance.To answer your question,my favourite dance are as follows with definitions:</p>

    <p>polynesian chiken dance<br>
     A little known but very essential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a wholevillage would dance aroundin a circle like chikens,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"

    </p>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
        Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,which involve huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around imperceptibility,tiny very rapid movements.One of my fellow students use to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as twerking.</p>
        <p>Arctic robot dance<br>
            an interesting example of historic misinformation,Englishe explorers in the 1960s beleived to have discovered a new dance style characterised by"robotic" silted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of northern alaska in Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were jsut moving like this because they were really cold.

        </p>
        <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="https://exotic dance research page.com"target="_blank">exotic dance research page</a></p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
        <p>Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
